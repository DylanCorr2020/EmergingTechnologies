This is the repository for the Emerging Technologies Module.
<br>

## Introduction

This GitHub repository is set up using JupyterLite containing three JupyterLite notebooks:

- Computation
- Fourier Transform
- Quantum Computing
  <br>

## Repository Setup

This repository was created by copying a JupyterLite template click [here](https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo) and served using GitHub Pages/Actions.
<br>

Here are the steps that were used to set up GitHub Pages/Actions after copying the JupyterLite template click [here](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/deploy.html).

## Computation Jupyter Notebook

This jupyter notebook describes a quick overview of some computational problems, setting the stage for Quantum Computation later.

## Fourier Transform Jupyter Notebook

- This jupyter notebook describes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
  which is an algorithm for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence of data points.

## Quantum Computing Jupyter Notebook

- This jupyter notebook describes quantum computing and classical
  computing as well and provides an explantion and simulation of Deutschâ€™s algorithm using <i> qiskit </i>.

## Requirements

- GitHub Pages/Actions
- JupyterLite and Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda
- Qiskit
